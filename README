1. Make sure that you have built cdb2jdbc.
2. Run `make' to compile.
3. Run `CLUSTER=<your_cluster> DB=<your_db> make call' to invoke the CLI.
   You could also export those environment variables first and then run `make call'.


Using @bind directive

The syntax is,
	@bind <type> <indx> <value>

Type can be one of "integer", "real" and "cstring". The support for other types will be added later.
JDBC only supports index-based parameter binding, so you'd need to bind to index in cdb2jdbcli too.
Note that in JDBC, the index starts at 1.

Examples

$ CLUSTER=alpha DB=ixmmdb make call
cdb2jdbc> @bind cstring 1 pi
cdb2jdbc> @bind real 2 3.1415923
cdb2jdbc> select ? as key, ? as value
(key=pi, value=3.1415923)
